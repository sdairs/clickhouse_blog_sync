# Getting Data Into ClickHouse - Part 1

This blog post is part of a series:

## Getting Data Into ClickHouse

A common question from ClickHouse users who are just getting started is how to load data into ClickHouse efficiently. In this blog series, we will demonstrate several options to achieve this task: from the clickhouse-client to officially supported client libraries. In this specific post, we start simple by relying on schema inference and assuming our dataset is sufficiently structured, perfectly clean (almost), and ready for immediate insertion. Later posts will introduce advanced techniques for data cleansing and schema optimization.

As both ClickHouse users and data lovers, we’re always looking for interesting datasets of sufficient size to challenge ClickHouse: we even track potential opportunities for fun with a specific [GitHub label](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset) on the main repository. This post originates from [an issue](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29693) to explore [Hacker News data](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). To keep things simple, we distribute a clean version of this dataset in several formats. Users should be able to reproduce all examples.

All examples use a ClickHouse Cloud instance with the client hosted on a [c5ad.4xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/) with 16 cores and 32GB of RAM. All commands will also be compatible with self managed ClickHouse clusters. High end machines speed up the process, but you can run these steps on the average laptop.


### Download

A CSV version of the dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hackernews/hacknernews.csv.gz), or by running this command:


```bash
wget https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hackernews/hacknernews.csv.gz
```


At 4.6GB, and 28m rows, this compressed file should take 5-10 minutes to download.

### Sampling

[clickhouse-local](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/utilities/clickhouse-local/) allows users to perform fast processing on local files without having to deploy and configure the ClickHouse server.

Before storing any data in ClickHouse, let's sample the file using clickhouse-local. From the clickhouse-local console:

```
clickhouse-local
```

```
SELECT *
FROM file('hacknernews.csv.gz', CSVWithNames)
LIMIT 2
SETTINGS input_format_try_infer_datetimes = 0
FORMAT Vertical

There are a lot of subtle capabilities in this command.  The [file](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/files/#file) operator allows us to read the file from a local disk, specifying only the format “CSVWithNames”. Most importantly, the schema is automatically inferred for us from the file contents. Note also how clickhouse-local is able to read the compressed file, inferring the gzip format from the extension.  We format Verticially for the purposes of rendering.

As well as inferring the structure, schema inference determines a type for each column. 

An astute reader may have noticed that we used the setting `input_format_try_infer_datetimes=0`. This setting disables date parsing during schema inference as, at the time of writing (22.8),  the datetimes in this specific CSV file cannot be parsed automatically. This has been addressed in later versions.

### Loading the Data

Our simplest and most powerful tool for data loading is the [clickhouse-client](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/cli/#clickhouse-client): a feature-rich native command-line client. To load data, we can again exploit schema inference, relying on ClickHouse to determine the types of the columns. 

In the following command, we create a table and insert the data directly from the remote CSV file, accessing the contents via the [url](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/table-functions/url) function. The schema is inferred, and the data is effortlessly inserted to the table. Execute the following from the clickhouse-client console.

```
CREATE TABLE hackernews ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY tuple
(
) EMPTY AS SELECT * FROM url('https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hackernews/hacknernews.csv.gz', 'CSVWithNames');
```

This creates an empty table using the schema inferred from the data. The DESCRIBE command allows us to understand these assigned types.

```
DESCRIBE TABLE hackernews
┌─name────────┬─type─────────────────────┬
│ id          │ Nullable(Float64)        │
│ deleted     │ Nullable(Float64)        │
│ type        │ Nullable(String)         │
│ by          │ Nullable(String)         │
│ time        │ Nullable(String)         │
│ text        │ Nullable(String)         │
│ dead        │ Nullable(Float64)        │
│ parent      │ Nullable(Float64)        │
│ poll        │ Nullable(Float64)        │
│ kids        │ Array(Nullable(Float64)) │
│ url         │ Nullable(String)         │
│ score       │ Nullable(Float64)        │
│ title       │ Nullable(String)         │
│ parts       │ Array(Nullable(Float64)) │
│ descendants │ Nullable(Float64)        │
└─────────────┴──────────────────────────┴
```

For insertion we can utilize an [INSERT INTO, SELECT](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/insert-into/#inserting-the-results-of-select), streaming the data directly from the url.

```
INSERT INTO hackernews SELECT *
FROM url('https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hackernews/hacknernews.csv.gz', 'CSVWithNames')

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 203.682 sec. Processed 28.74 million rows, 15.15 GB (141.09 thousand rows/s., 74.40 MB/s.)
```

The table schema here is far from optimal, and the insertion speed could be improved significantly with some simple settings. We leave this task for later blog posts. We have, however, successfully inserted 28m rows into ClickHouse with a single command!

Let's sample the Hacker News stories and specific columns.

```
SELECT
    id,
    title,
    type,
    by,
    time,
    url,
    score
FROM hackernews
WHERE type = 'story'
LIMIT 3
FORMAT Vertical

Row 1:
──────

Row 2:

```

While schema inference is a great tool for initial data exploration, it is “best effort” and not a long-term substitute for defining an optimal schema for your data. 

### Define a schema

An obvious immediate optimization is to define a type for each field. As well as declaring the time field as a DateTime, we define an appropriate type for each of the fields below after dropping our existing dataset. Also, note that we define a primary key id for our data via the ORDER BY clause. This is a little beyond this post's scope, but readers are recommended to read our introduction to [ClickHouse primary keys](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/guides/improving-query-performance/sparse-primary-indexes/sparse-primary-indexes-intro). In summary, this will make some queries faster and help with compression.

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hackernews;
 
CREATE TABLE hackernews
(
   `id` UInt32,
   `deleted` UInt8,
   `type` Enum('story' = 1, 'comment' = 2, 'poll' = 3, 'pollopt' = 4, 'job' = 5),
   `by` LowCardinality(String),
   `time` DateTime,
   `text` String,
   `dead` UInt8,
   `parent` UInt32,
   `poll` UInt32,
   `kids` Array(UInt32),
   `url` String,
   `score` Int32,
   `title` String,
   `parts` Array(UInt32),
   `descendants` Int32
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id
```

With an optimized schema, we can now demonstrate inserting data from the local file system. Again we turn to clickhouse-client, inserting the file using the [INFILE](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/insert-into/#inserting-data-from-a-file) clause with an explicit [INSERT INTO](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/insert-into/#inserting-data-from-a-file). Again this is capable of reading the gz file.


```
INSERT INTO hackernews FROM INFILE '/data/hacknernews.csv.gz' FORMAT CSVWithNames

Query id: 35fa5a90-68ea-466f-bdb5-cdd24f33f047

Ok.

28737557 rows in set. Elapsed: 93.824 sec.
```

There is much more we can do here to optimize this schema - codecs and support for text tokenization on the text column would be a start, but we’ll explore these in later posts.

### Simple queries

[Our first thoughts](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/29693#issuecomment-933086439) were to investigate how pervasive ClickHouse is a topic in Hacker News and whether this is increasing over time. The [score](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) field provides us with a metric of popularity for stories, while the id field and [|| concatenation operator](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/operators/#concatenation-operator) can be used to produce a link to the original post. 

```
SELECT
    time,
    score,
    descendants,
    title,
    url,
    'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=' || toString(id) AS hn_url

Is ClickHouse generating more noise over time? Note the importance here of our work to ensure the time field is a DateTime, using a proper data type allows us to use the toYYYYMM() function.

```
SELECT
   toYYYYMM(time) AS monthYear,
   bar(count(), 0, 120, 20)
FROM hackernews
WHERE (type IN ('story', 'comment')) AND ((title ILIKE '%ClickHouse%') OR (text ILIKE '%ClickHouse%'))
GROUP BY monthYear
ORDER BY monthYear ASC

### Other formats

One of the strengths of ClickHouse is its ability to handle any [number of formats](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/formats/). We appreciate that CSV represents a rather ideal use case, as well as not being the most efficient for data exchange. Both Parquet and JSON are common interchange formats for different reasons. While Parquet is an efficient column-oriented format, JSON has become the dominant means of data transfer for semi-structured information and the web. Both are supported in ClickHouse.

Parquet has [minimal types, ](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/types/)which ClickHouse needs to respect. This type information is encoded in the format itself. Type inference on a Parquet file will invariably lead to a slightly different schema. Below we demonstrate reading the same data in Parquet format, again using the url function to read the remote data. Note we have to accept that keys might be Null (although they aren’t in the data) as a condition of the Parquet format.


```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hackernews;

CREATE TABLE hackernews
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id
SETTINGS allow_nullable_key = 1 EMPTY AS
SELECT *
FROM url('https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hackernews/hacknernews.parquet', 'Parquet')

INSERT INTO hackernews SELECT *
FROM url('https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hackernews/hacknernews.parquet', 'Parquet')

Ok.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 314.165 sec. Processed 28.74 million rows, 13.95 GB (91.47 thousand rows/s., 44.39 MB/s.)
```


And the resulting schema, 


```
DESCRIBE TABLE hackernews

┌─name────────┬─type───────────────────┬
│ id          │ Nullable(Int64)        │
│ deleted     │ Nullable(UInt8)        │
│ type        │ Nullable(String)       │
│ time        │ Nullable(Int64)        │
│ text        │ Nullable(String)       │
│ dead        │ Nullable(UInt8)        │
│ parent      │ Nullable(Int64)        │
│ poll        │ Nullable(Int64)        │
│ kids        │ Array(Nullable(Int64)) │
│ url         │ Nullable(String)       │
│ score       │ Nullable(Int32)        │
│ title       │ Nullable(String)       │
│ parts       │ Array(Nullable(Int64)) │
│ descendants │ Nullable(Int32)        │
└─────────────┴────────────────────────┴
```


ndJson represents a common interchange format. ClickHouse supports parsing this data through the JSONEachRow format. For the purposes of example, we load a ndjson version of the file from disk. 


```
wget https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hackernews/hacknernews.json.gz

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hackernews;
CREATE TABLE hackernews
(
  `id` UInt32,
  `deleted` UInt8,
  `type` Enum('story' = 1, 'comment' = 2, 'poll' = 3, 'pollopt' = 4, 'job' = 5),
  `by` LowCardinality(String),
  `time` DateTime,
  `text` String,
  `dead` UInt8,
  `parent` UInt32,
  `poll` UInt32,
  `kids` Array(UInt32),
  `url` String,
  `score` Int32,
  `title` String,
  `parts` Array(UInt32),
  `descendants` Int32
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id;

INSERT INTO hackernews FROM INFILE '/data/hacknernews.json.gz' FORMAT JSONEachRow

Ok.

28737557 rows in set. Elapsed: 94.491 sec.
```

### Summary

In this post we explored getting data into ClickHouse from local and remote files. We exploited schema inference and demonstrated the support for several popular file formats. In future posts, we’ll look to optimize the schema and insert/read performance before demonstrating the loading of data using other clients.
