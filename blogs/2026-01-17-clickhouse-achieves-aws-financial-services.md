# ClickHouse achieves AWS Financial Services Competency

We're excited to announce that ClickHouse has achieved the[ AWS Financial Services Competency](https://aws.amazon.com/financial-services/partner-solutions/), recognizing our track record of supporting global financial institutions in turning data into decisions and insights at speed and scale.

### Meeting the unique demands of financial data

Financial services organizations face many challenging data requirements, including real-time market data streaming at millions of events per second, complex fraud detection across billions of transactions, regulatory compliance monitoring that demands instant query response, customer analytics that must operate at massive scale while maintaining sub-second latency, to name just a few. 

ClickHouse is designed for this scale. With columnar storage delivering high compression and fast scans, a parallel execution engine that handles massive concurrency, and robust support for time-series operations and window functions make complex financial analysis practical and intuitive.

As a result, they reduced their dashboard load times from 5-6 seconds to under half a second, achieving an 80% improvement in response times, while also cutting infrastructure costs by 50%. As Salim Sayed and Syd Mehmood at Capital One explain: "At Capital One, we want to give teams the data they need, when they need it, to make informed FinOps decisions. With ClickHouse, we can: spot trends early … foster shared accountability … and plan smarter."
