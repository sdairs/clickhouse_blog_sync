# April 2026 newsletter

Hello, and welcome to the April 2026 ClickHouse newsletter!

This month, we have a new CLI for ClickHouse local and cloud, agentic coding at ClickHouse, materialized CTEs in our latest release, building a SIEM, and more!

## Featured community member: Nazarii Piontko {#featured-community-member}

This month's featured community member is Nazarii Piontko, Solutions Architect at Future Processing.

He leads technical presales and architecture, translating complex requirements into solutions for clients across trading, mobility, and logistics. He stays hands-on through open-source contributions to distributed data systems, mentors engineers, and has taught at universities.

Nazarii contributed two features to ClickHouse 26.3 LTS: the [`naturalSortKey`](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/90322) function, which enables intuitive sorting of strings containing numbers (so "file10" sorts after "file9", not "file1"), and support for the [ALP compression codec](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/91362), which brings efficient lossless compression for floating-point data.

## Open House 2026 {#open-house}

It's just over a month until the second edition of [Open House](https://clickhouse.com/openhouse/san-francisco), a free three-day ClickHouse user conference running May 26–28 in San Francisco.

Kick things off on May 26 with hands-on workshops covering real-time analytics, observability, database administration, and data warehousing, then head into two days of keynotes, technical sessions, and networking.

Hear from ClickHouse CEO Aaron Katz and CTO Alexey Milovidov, plus industry guests including Bret Taylor (Sierra) and Guillermo Rauch (Vercel). Admission is free!

## 26.3 release {#26-3-release}

26.3 sees the experimental introduction of materialized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and WebAssembly User-defined functions (UDFs).

This release also makes asynchronous inserts the default, enables JOIN reordering for ANTI, SEMI, and FULL, and improves the internal storage of the ClickHouse Map data type.

## Introducing clickhousectl: the CLI for ClickHouse local and cloud (beta) {#introducing-clickhousectl}

![april_2026_clickhouse-ctl.png](https://clickhouse.com/uploads/april_2026_clickhouse_ctl_e3d28f3583.png)

Alasdair Brown announced clickhousectl, a CLI for managing both local ClickHouse installations and cloud deployments, built with AI agents in mind alongside human developers.

Designed for agentic development, it handles local version management, project scaffolding, and server lifecycle, while also supporting cloud infrastructure commands with authentication safeguards like read-only OAuth and permissioned API keys.

## How Goldsky made historical blockchain data backfills 12x faster {#how-goldsky-made-historical-blockchain-data-backfills-12x-faster}

![](https://clickhouse.com/uploads/newsletter_apr2026_image6_7949daf91e.png)

Goldsky sped up historical blockchain backfills by 12x by replacing their Kafka/Avro pipeline with direct ClickHouse reads using the Apache Arrow format.

Eliminating deserialization overhead by reading data in the format closest to its physical storage proved extremely efficient, boosting throughput from ~50K to ~600K rows/second.

## Agentic coding at ClickHouse {#agentic-coding-at-clickhouse}

![](https://clickhouse.com/uploads/newsletter_apr2026_image7_ffb09aaaf1.png)

Our CTO, Alexey Milovidov, argues that agentic coding has crossed the threshold into genuine usefulness for professional software development, driven by recent model improvements such as Claude Opus 4.5.

He walks through how we've achieved productivity gains by using AI agents across a wide range of tasks - fixing flaky tests, investigating bugs, code reviews, security research, and more.

The key takeaway: As of today, agents work best as pair programmers under an engineer's direction, not as autonomous replacements.

## Building a SIEM with ClickHouse and Clickdetect {#building-a-siem-with-clickhouse-and-clickdetect}

![](https://clickhouse.com/uploads/newsletter_apr2026_image3_f7c3e467cd.png)

Vinicius Morais walks through building a SIEM architecture using ClickHouse and Clickdetect, an open-source detection engine that runs SQL-based security rules against your log data.

He uses Wazuh (an open-source security platform) solely as a log collector and decoder, forwarding parsed alerts to a ClickHouse table with compression codecs, TTLs, bloom filter indexes, and S3 storage support.

From there, Clickdetect schedules detections and fires alerts to a webhook — giving you a lightweight, cost-effective SIEM that scales from a single node to a distributed ClickHouse cluster.

## Building high-performance full-text search for object storage {#building-high-performance-full-text-search-for-object-storage}

![](https://clickhouse.com/uploads/newsletter_apr2026_image8_39f30f112c.png)

Last month, we announced that Full-text search was generally available. We now have a blog post written by the engineering team explaining how they redesigned the FTS index to work efficiently with object storage, where random reads are expensive.

The new index uses front-coding compression, a sparse lookup index, and adaptive posting lists, allowing many queries to be answered from the index alone without touching the underlying text columns.
