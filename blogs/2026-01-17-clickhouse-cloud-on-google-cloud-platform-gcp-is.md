# ClickHouse Cloud on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is Generally Available

We are thrilled to [announce ClickHouse Cloud is now Generally Available on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/blog/clickhouse-cloud-expands-choice-with-launch-on-google-cloud-platform) in three geographies - United States (Iowa), Europe (Netherlands) and Asia (Singapore).


This release is a major milestone in our cloud journey, as we expand to offer users more flexibility and choice for deploying ClickHouse services. In early May, we announced the [Public Beta](/blog/clickhouse-cloud-on-gcp-available-in-public-beta) of ClickHouse Cloud on GCP. This milestone included features such as integration with Google Cloud Storage, end-to-end encryption, endpoint security controls with IP Access List, and many more. 

In GA, we have added the following new capabilities:

* **Marketplace Subscription:** Subscribe to the service [via the Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/clickhouse-public/clickhouse-cloud?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=clickhouse&utm_campaign=gcp-ga) to consolidate your billing.
* **Private Service Connect:** Advanced protection of your data on the wire by using Google Cloud’s private network.
* **Disaster Recovery:** All services come with daily backups, free of charge for two days.
* **Service Level Agreements:** Available for users that sign up for committed spend contracts.
