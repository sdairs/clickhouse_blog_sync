# ClickHouse Meetup in Limassol on May 7, 2019

The first open-air ClickHouse Meetup took place in the heart of Limassol, the second-largest city of Cyprus, on the roof kindly provided by Exness Group. The views were stunning, but speakers did a great job competing with them for audience attention. Over one hundred people have joined in, which once again confirms high interest in ClickHouse around the globe. Meetup content is also available as [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rpU-TvSfZ8).

[Kirill Shvakov](https://github.com/kshvakov) has played the key role in making this event possible by reaching out to the ClickHouse Community at Cyprus, finding the great venue, and other speakers. Most of the worldwide ClickHouse Meetups happen thanks to active community members like Kirill, if you want to help us organize ClickHouse Meetup in your area, please reach the ClickHouse team via [this form](https://clickhouse.com/#meet) or any other convenient way.

Kirill is well known for his top-notch [ClickHouse Go Driver](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse-go) running over native protocol, but his opening talk was about his experience optimizing ClickHouse queries and solving real-world tasks at Integros and Wisebits.

...but it took just around one hour for nature to turn the night mode on. It made the projected slides easier to read.

Unfortunately, midnight was closing in and only the most weather-proof ClickHouse fans have managed to stay the whole event as it started getting pretty chilly.
