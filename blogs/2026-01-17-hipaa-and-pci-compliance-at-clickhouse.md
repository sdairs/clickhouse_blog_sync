# HIPAA and PCI Compliance at ClickHouse

We at ClickHouse are excited to share some great news: HIPAA and PCI self-service deployments are now generally available in ClickHouse Cloud! This is a game-changer, empowering our customers to manage their crucial data security needs with ease and confidence.

### Protecting Health Information

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a cornerstone of U.S. law, dedicated to safeguarding the most sensitive medical information. We’re talking about **electronic protected health information (ePHI or PHI)**, which includes any information relating to a patient’s condition in the past, present or future, provision of healthcare, or payment thereof, that can be associated with a person’s identity. HIPAA outlines the requirements for both **covered entities** (like doctors, hospitals, and health plans) and their **business associates** (organizations like ClickHouse that help covered entities and other business associates process this vital data). ClickHouse built a compliance program around the HIPAA [Security Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html), ensuring we provide robust administrative and technical safeguards, and work with our cloud providers to ensure compliance down to the hardware.

### Securing Payment Card Data
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ([PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/pci-dss/)) are a set of robust standards set forth by the PCI Security Standards Council designed to protect **payment card data** as it is stored, processed and transmitted. At ClickHouse, we proudly adhere to the stringent Level 1 Service Provider requirements of the PCI DSS, ensuring that your customers’ sensitive cardholder data is always safe.
