# Unordered mode for GCS ClickPipes is now available

> *Ingest data from Google Cloud Storage into ClickHouse Cloud in **any** **order** for event-driven, blazing-fast analytics. Files are no longer required to follow lexicographical order.*

A few months ago, we removed one of the biggest usability wrinkles in S3 ClickPipes by [supporting ingesting files in any order](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickpipes-s3-unordered-mode) (*aka* unordered mode). We’re now extending that functionality to the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) connector, with a little help from [Google Cloud Pub/Sub notifications for Cloud Storage](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications).

This means that you no longer need to worry about ensuring files land in your bucket in lexicographical order: with unordered mode, we’ll simply listen to notifications for new files and ingest files as they land in the GCS bucket. Whether you’re dealing with backfills, retries, late-arriving data, or some other source of out-of-orderness — this is now covered.

## Why is this a big deal? {#why-is-this-a-big-deal}

By default, the GCS ClickPipe assumes files are added to a bucket in lexicographical order, and relies on this implicit order to ingest files sequentially. This means that any new file *must* be lexically greater than the last ingested file, which isn’t always true in the real world. For example, files named `events_2024-12-01.parquet`, `events_2024-12-02.parquet`, and `events_2024-12-03.parquet` will be ingested in order, but if a backfill named `events_2024-11-30.parquet` lands later in the bucket, it will be ignored.

Not cool.

With unordered mode, this limitation no longer applies: instead of polling the bucket every 30 seconds looking for the next file to process, the ClickPipe waits for new file notifications. When a notification arrives, ClickPipes just goes and processes that file regardless of its relative order to previously processed files. Although this requires a little extra configuration, it's a more robust and scalable approach when you’re dealing with millions of objects.

## How does it work? {#how-does-it-work}

To configure a GCS ClickPipe to ingest files that don’t have an implicit order, you need to configure notifications from the bucket to a Pub/Sub topic. ClickPipes can then listen for `OBJECT_FINALIZE` events and ingest any new files regardless of the file naming convention.  

![564927906-277a62f5-799d-4d30-951d-35ebc8b346f2.jpg](https://clickhouse.com/uploads/564927906_277a62f5_799d_4d30_951d_35ebc8b346f2_56abffa4ed.jpg)

_**Unordered mode:** Files land in GCS in **any order** (A) and trigger Pub/Sub notifications (B-C). ClickPipes polls and processes files in the specified path, using a metadata store to track state (1-5). Data is inserted into the target tables with exactly-once guarantees (6)._

***“What about failures?”*** Since the steps above span multiple systems and don’t happen in a single transaction, failures can occur at any step — reading from GCS, marking files as processed, inserting data into ClickHouse, and so on. If a failure occurs, ClickPipes automatically reprocesses the batch. ***"But what about duplicates?”*** Even if files are reprocessed multiple times, the GCS ClickPipe guarantees exactly-once semantics, so no duplicates make it into your target table.

Let’s see it in action!

### Create a Pub/Sub topic {#create-a-pubsub-topic}

*The following instructions assume you already have a GCS bucket with some data in it, as well as enough permissions to manage IAM roles and create new resources in your Google Cloud account.*

**1\.** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **Pub/Sub > Topics > Create topic**. Create a new topic with a default subscription and note the **Topic Name**.

**2\.** Configure a [service account](http://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) with the minimum required set of permissions to allow ClickPipes to list and fetch objects in the specified bucket, as well as consume and monitor notifications from the Pub/Sub subscription.

**3\.** Configure your GCS bucket to send notifications to Pub/Sub when a new object lands in the bucket. This step cannot be performed in the Google Cloud Console, so you must use `gcloud` or your preferred programmatic interface.

**3.1.** Using `gcloud`, add a notification configuration to your GCS bucket that triggers notifications for the `OBJECT_FINALIZE` [event type](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications#events):

<pre><code language='bash'>
# Create a Pub/Sub notification for new objects in the bucket
gcloud storage buckets notifications create "gs://${YOUR_BUCKET_NAME}" \
--topic="projects/${YOUR_PROJECT_ID}/topics/${YOUR_TOPIC_NAME}" \
--event-types="OBJECT_FINALIZE" \
--payload-format="json"

# List the Pub/Sub notifications in the bucket
gcloud storage buckets notifications describe
</code></pre>

We strongly recommend configuring a [**Dead-Letter topic**](https://docs.cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/dead-letter-topics), too, so it's easier to debug and retry failed notifications. But that’s it — you’re ready to create a ClickPipe to continuously ingest data from your bucket whenever a new file lands!

### Create a ClickPipe {#create-a-clickpipe}

**1\.** In the ClickHouse Cloud console, navigate to **Data Sources > Create ClickPipe**, then choose **Google Cloud Storage**. Enter the details to connect to your GCS bucket, using **Service account** as the authentication method and providing the `.json` service account key.

**2\.** Toggle on **Continuous ingestion**, then select the new **Any order** ingestion mode to enable unordered mode. Enter the path to your Pub/Sub subscription.

![](https://clickhouse.com/uploads/gcs_unordered_mar2026_image5_01fc577707.png)

**3\.** Click **Incoming data**. Define a **Sorting key** for the target table (very important) and make any necessary adjustments to the mapped schema. Finally, configure a role for the ClickPipes database user.

**4\.** **Sit back and relax.** ClickPipes will now perform an initial scan of your bucket, then start processing files as new notification events arrive. 🚀

If that seems like a lot of clicking, the good news is that ClickPipes is fully supported in the [ClickHouse Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ClickHouse/clickhouse/latest/docs), so you can configure this setup as code from start to finish.

## What’s next? {#whats-next}

We’re excited to enable more complex ingestion patterns from object storage into ClickHouse Cloud with the new unordered mode in GCS ClickPipes — you get the same fully-managed, full-speed experience with a little extra flexibility! This feature is also available for Amazon S3 as a data source. We plan to extend support to Azure Blob Storage in the near future, to ensure feature parity across **all** Object Storage ClickPipes.
