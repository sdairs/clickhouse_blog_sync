**tl;dr – Join us virtually or June 8th in Amsterdam – [Watch Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP7l6Swkskw&ab_channel=ClickHouse)!**

Following the success of our day of virtual meetups, we’ve decided it is time to meet again…in person.

A significant portion of the ClickHouse team will be in Amsterdam. So we decided to take the opportunity to get together, talk tech, and share some food. Please [register now](https://www.meetup.com/clickhouse-netherlands-user-group/events/286017044/) so that we can ensure sufficient space and food. It’s not just an opportunity to network, though. You will hear stories of ClickHouse powering a performance & monitoring service and a detailed exploration of how, and why, ClickHouse is so fast.

We’ve identified a venue…

We’ve found speakers…

Our founding team will be in town…

All that is missing is you!


## **Why a Meetup?**

ClickHouse, as an open-source company, is rooted deeply in the importance of community. The opportunity to interact with our users, in physical space, is core to the identity of our team.

In addition, our history (as a company and individuals) is built on the power of conversation. Some of the stories we share, and memories we cherish, involve a small venue, lightning talks, and conversations that last until security reminds us that the booking period is over.

Our community matters. Our interaction with our community is core to who we are and who we aspire to be.


## **Agenda**

The current agenda is as follows:

17:45 Doors Open – Networking & Snacks

18:00 Welcome

18:05 Lorenzo Mangani, QXIP BV – 45 mins
